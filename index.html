    <h3>Why are dogs so important?</h3>
    <p>Having a dog can make a persons life improve in dramatic ways. Some people have dogs as companions and others have dogs that provide them with a life changing service. Let us take a look at a few of the roles a dog can play in a persons life.</p>

          <h4>Service Dogs</h4>
          <p>A service dog is one that we see quite frequently. They provide different services to their owners in order to make their day to day life more manageable. A service dog can be the difference between life and death for those who have health issues.</p>

          <h4>Family Dogs</h4>
          <p>Most households have a dog that is a member of their family, and they trust them implicitly. Their children are raised around them and they offer their family a companionship that cannot be duplicated. For some people a dog is all that they have. This animal offers them companionship that they cannot get elsewhere.

          <h4>In My Experience</h4>
          <p>My dog Sandy has offered me more than just companionship. She is a motive for me to work hard and better myself. The harder I work the more that I achieve and the better my life will be. Which in turn will improve her life. She offers me a constant comfort with her presence alone</p>
